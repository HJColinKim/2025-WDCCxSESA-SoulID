## üöÄ Take a trip into the past!
Though the internet of the late 90s promised a brand new world of instant connection, boundless knowledge and endless creativity, the **[reality wasn't always as bright as promised]**. 

This is what our team: SOUL ID wanted to capture and bring to the modern generation of today, and to journey the older generations back into their humble past plagued with blocky UI, chaotic pop-ups and retro sound design. 
We believed that through vision, passion and a whole lot of trial and error, Software Engineers of the past have brought the standard of the internet high up from what it was back in the days. Thus, this web-experience is more than just a game, 
it is a narrative; a story that we tell of the roots of the internet, and how far we have come. The gameplay experience our website showcases brings users back into their childhood: reviving memories of **[Retro VideoGames]**, but our website's design 
as a whole wipes the dust off the 1995 web experience, bringing it live to both younger and older generations to relive once again. 

This is our homage to those internet pioneers and future developers who will make the internet a better place.

The hackathon theme was **[NOSTALGIA]**, which inspired us to build this product in under [e.g., 48] hours that would allow users to relive an unforgettable experience.

## üí° About the experience

### What We Built
**[Nostalgia Guesser]** is a [Web-game] that surpasses a regular web-gaming experience. [It allows users of the site to journey into the internet of the late 1990s, and reconnect with their nostalgia]. 

The core features we successfully implemented during the hackathon include:
* **Feature 1:** [A functioning gameplay, involving a Couch Co-op mechanic where users must team up to try guess the RETRO video game. Users are provided with a pixelated image, as well as an audio queue. With each successive incorrect guess, the image gets LESS pixelated, and the audio sample becomes LONGER]    <img width="1900" height="939" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/928166ea-4b02-48fe-ae88-780fff9cf44b" />

* **Feature 2:** [An impressive UI that we are very proud of: showcases the UI design of the late 1990s internet web perfectly, accompanied by old-school advertisements on the side.]    <img width="1895" height="938" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90cc0b92-7f2e-42c0-bc33-046a1d745ff6" />

* **Feature 3:** [The creative addition of POP-UPS as a CORE game mechanic. We created unique pop-ups with old-school AUDIO that are reminiscint of the past days of the internet, and took this to the extreme. Users must manage pop-ups while trying to listen to the audio queue and look at the image clue to guess the retro game. The difficulty of our game experience can be changed in the settings menu, where users can change the frequency of pop-ups on the screen, as well as disable sound-effects.]<img width="317" height="198" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6b06cf5-9b85-4ece-8290-2310f8a86f14" />

* **Feature 4:** [We have implemented a chat-bot system that allows users to interact with video game titles/characters once they have successfully guessed the correct game. As of now, the chat-bot responses are scripted; however, we are looking into easily linking an AI model to implement more complex conversations. In this way, users can learn about these RETRO games] <img width="1871" height="924" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe447bfc-e021-413c-9a70-84128db367f6" />


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

We chose a modern and efficient stack to build our prototype quickly. The main technologies we used were:
- **[React + TypeScript]** for the webapp design
- **[Tailwind CSS]** for the much-needed enhancing UI visuals
- **[Next.js]** for effective deployment of the webapp
- **[Vercel]** for deployment (our site is deployed for access)
